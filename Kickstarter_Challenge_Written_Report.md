# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Compare success/fail/cancel rates of plays based on their launch dates and goals.
### Purpose
Exercise excel skills - COUNTIFS(), Percentage, Average, SUM, create graphs, compare data.
## Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was remembering when comparing my data to that in the modules was forgetting to only pull plays for the Outcomes Based on Goals. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The best months to put on a production would be May, June or July. Overall, May is the best/most successful month for a launch date. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Overall, based on goals, plays less than $1,000 are the most successful. You would be more successful with your play if it is $1,000 or less. Plays with goals between $45,000-$49,999 failed 100% of the time.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When I compared my graph to the graph in the module for deliverable 2 mine did not match. I found I forgot to pull only plays. It was an easy fix but just a reminder to pay attention to the small things/details.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month of May not only has the highest number of successful theaters launched as well as the best percentage. Therefore, the best launch month for a theater would be the month of May. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The best success rate based on goals comes from the plays below the $1000 range. However, when looking at that data you can conclude that you would make less than $141,000 due to the 141 plays being less than $1,000. The next best success rate based on goals comes from the $5,000-$9,999 range. Therefore, you could make $388,000-$1,939,612. Based on the goals I would say the best range for the plays would be the goal amount between $1,000-$4,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of the dataset would be these are only a select set of plays put on by Louise. These are not a collective of different locations, genres and demographics. These plays are very specific to a specific person and location. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have done a box and whisker plot to see if goals of plays she wants to produce would be near the mean pledged amount. This would allow us to make the decision to lower the goal amount closer or below the pledged amount.
